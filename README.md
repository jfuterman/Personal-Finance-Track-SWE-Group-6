# Welcome to WealthWise

WealthWise is a full stack web application that helps users budget, save, and meet their financial goals.

### Frontend

We use React with TypeScript based on Figma designs.

### Backend

This project uses Django and Python. It hosts user data in a database managed with PostgreSQL and retrieves financial data with the Plaid API.

### DevOps

We use Docker to manage development.

## Using the project

Get started by cloning this repository. If you've got Docker installed on your computer, run `docker compose up --build`. This will spin up the database, Django, and front end services.

If you don't have Docker, create your virtual environment and install the dependencies. Depending on your system and version of Python, you'll run `python -m venv .venv` to create the virtual environment and then `source venv/bin/activate` to activate it. Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the project dependencies.

### Launch Django

Head to the `django` folder and run `python manage.py runserver`. You started the Django server!

### Launch frontend

Head to the `frontend` folder and run `npm start`. You started the frontend server!

## Contribution Guidelines for WealthWise

### I have to change the codebase. What do I do?
All changes will follow this general pattern:
1. Switch to the main branch using `git checkout main`
2. Use `git pull` to retrieve all of the latest changes to `main`.
3. Use `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`. This creates a new branch for you to work off of. Pick a name that describes what you're doing on this branch.
4. Make your desired changes, committing often. Once the feature is done and works, submit a Pull Request and ask a team member to review and merge your changes into the main branch.

### Branching Strategy

We'll follow the Git Feature Branch Workflow:

| Branch           | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`           | Production-ready, stable builds                   |
| `dev`            | Integration branch (latest development)           |
| `feature/<name>` | New features (e.g., `feature/recurring-expenses`) |
| `bugfix/<name>`  | Fixing issues (e.g., `bugfix/login-error`)        |
| `hotfix/<name>`  | Critical production fixes                         |

### When to branch

Create a feature branch off dev before starting any new user story or task.

Only work on one task per branch to keep pull requests clean.

### Committing Code

Follow these commit guidelines to keep history clean and readable:

#### Small commits

Make focused commits for each logical change. **Avoid committing directly to dev or main.**

#### Pull Requests (PRs)

##### When to create a PR

When your task is completed and tested locally.

##### How?

Submit a PR from your feature/ or bugfix/ branch to dev.

##### PR Checklist

- Code compiles without errors.
- Youâ€™ve tested your feature or fix locally.
- No console errors or linter warnings.
- At least 1 other teammate has reviewed and approved the PR.

#### Merging & Pulling

Always pull the latest dev before creating or updating a branch.

If your branch is out of date, use:

`git pull origin dev`
`git merge dev`
After PR approval, a designated team member (rotating) merges it into dev.

#### Deployment

Code from dev will be deployed to a staging environment.

Only tested and approved features will be merged into main for production deployment.
