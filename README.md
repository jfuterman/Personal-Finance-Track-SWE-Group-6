# Welcome to WealthWise

WealthWise is a full stack web application that helps users budget, save, and meet their financial goals.

## Frontend

We use React with TypeScript based on Figma designs.

## Backend

We built this project with Django and Python. It hosts user data in a database managed with PostgreSQL and retrieves financial data with the Plaid API.

### Using the project

Get started by cloning this repository. Then, create your virtual environment and install the dependencies. Depending on your system and version of Python, you'll run `python -m venv .venv` to create the virtual environment. Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the project dependencies.

#### Launch Django

Head to the `django` folder and run `python manage.py runserver`. You started the Django server!
